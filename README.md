# Machine Learning Classification in the Medical Field

In this project, we explore machine learning classification algorithms in the medical field, specifically for the diagnosis of breast cancer. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify breast tumors as either malignant or benign using various numeric features and attributes of the tissue.

## Project Overview

- The first project focused on a machine learning regression application using multivariate linear regression to predict the required energy in an industrial process.
- In this project, we shift our focus to a machine learning classification application for breast cancer diagnosis.
- Two algorithms will be employed: logistic regression as a baseline and a neural network algorithm.
- The dataset used contains several numeric features derived from digitized medical images of breast masses.

## Importance of Machine Learning in Healthcare

Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning algorithms, plays a crucial role in the healthcare industry. Medical applications of machine learning, such as disease diagnosis and treatment, have the potential to significantly improve efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness in medical procedures.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of numeric features computed from digitized medical images of breast masses.
These features provide valuable information for diagnosing breast cancer. The ultimate goal is to build a robust classification model that accurately distinguishes between malignant and benign tumors.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Stores the trained models.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages for running the code.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the results and run the code in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to explore the data, preprocess it, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
